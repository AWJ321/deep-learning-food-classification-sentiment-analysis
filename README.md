# Deep Learning: Food Image Classification (CV) + Sentiment Analysis (NLP) with Benchmarking

This repository contains my Deep Learning module assignment covering two applied problem areas:

1. **Computer Vision:** Food image classification using a **CNN (TensorFlow/Keras)**
2. **Natural Language Processing:** Sentiment analysis using a **text preprocessing + neural network pipeline**, including **individual model development** and **group benchmarking / evaluation**

The focus is not only on building models, but also on **training diagnostics, evaluation, and comparative analysis**.

## Notebooks

### 1) Food Image Classification (CNN)

**Notebook:** `ASG_Problem1_Ang Wei Jun.ipynb`
**Goal:** Train a multi-class image classifier for food categories.

**Pipeline highlights**

* Dataset loading and split handling (train/validation/test)
* Image preprocessing (e.g., resizing/normalization)
* CNN architecture design (convolution + pooling + dense classifier)
* Model training with validation monitoring
* Evaluation on unseen data
* Training diagnostics using accuracy/loss curves to understand generalization

### 2) Sentiment Analysis (Individual Model)

**Notebook:** `ASG_Problem2_Ang Wei Jun.ipynb`
**Goal:** Build a sentiment classification model from text data.

**Pipeline highlights**

* Text preprocessing (tokenization / sequence preparation / encoding)
* Model training with validation tracking
* Evaluation using classification performance metrics
* Interpretation of model behavior and limitations

---

### 3) Sentiment Analysis (Group Benchmarking)

**Notebook:** `ASG_Problem2_Group.ipynb`
**Goal:** Compare and evaluate multiple independently developed sentiment models.

**Benchmarking highlights**

* Consolidated results across different model approaches
* Compared performance and generalization behavior
* Reflected on why models differ (preprocessing, architecture, training setup)
* Practiced evaluation thinking similar to real-world ML benchmarking

## Tech Stack

* Python
* TensorFlow / Keras
* NumPy, Pandas
* Matplotlib
* NLP preprocessing (tokenization, text encoding)
* Jupyter Notebook

## Notes on Datasets

Datasets are not included in this repository due to size and/or academic licensing. The notebooks document the full pipeline and can be adapted to equivalent public datasets.
